	<p>According to APACMed:<br><br>Medical Technology can be defined as the technologies that diagnose, treat and/or improve a person’s health and wellbeing, encompassing both low- and high-risk medical devices – products that can be as varied from tongue depressors, surgical gloves and medical thermometers to insulin pumps, pacemakers and in vitro diagnostics – and used to save the lives of patients everywhere across Asia Pacific every day.

Medical devices assist healthcare professionals to diagnose and treat patients with a higher level of accuracy and in a timelier fashion, and help patients overcome sickness or disease, improving their quality of life.

And while a global definition of what defines as a medical device is difficult to establish due to the various regulatory bodies worldwide that oversee the use and categorisation of medical devices, there is a very high likelihood that people are surrounded by medical devices without even realising it.

		<h1>HISTORY OF BIOMATERIALS</h1>

	<article>	
	<p>
	In 1987, the European Society for Biomaterials defined “biomaterial” as a nonbiological material used in a medical device with the purpose to interact with biological systems. The definition for biomaterial has undergone changes over time, including different definitions depending on the applied context. Currently, biomaterials are defined as those who interact with biological systems to evaluate, treat or heal, replace any tissue or body function.
	<br></br>
	A biomaterial is distinguished by its biocompatibility, which is the ability of a material to promote an adequate response from the host in a specific situation. The definition of biocompatibility is also subject to different interpretations according to the required performance or function. In the work of Chen et al. it is referred that in some studies, biocompatibility is evaluated by its ability to induce cell death or living tissues, tumor formation, genetic damage, immune response, or blood clot formation. Taking this diversity of questions into account, the Food Drug Administration (FDA) established that to be considered biocompatible, a material should not cause harm to the patient. Thus, the biocompatibility of a medical device must consider the biological compatibility of the materials used, as well as its design, for example, the geometry, electric control, and mechanical performance.

		<h1>DIFFERENT PURPOSES OF MEDICAL DEVICES</h1>
		<p>According to WHO, ‘Medical device’ means any instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, appliance, implant, reagent for in vitro use, software, material or other similar or related article, intended by the manufacturer to be used, alone or in combination, for human beings, for one or more of the specific medical purpose(s) of:

		The functional characteristics of a biomaterial must comply, some of the main requirements described by Reinwald5 are safety that is considered to be the most important feature of a medical device, durability in order to minimize the number of surgical interventions, biocompatibility where the host must tolerate the imposed material, regardless of the duration of the contact, bio functionality when the suitability of the intervention must be ensured to avoid interferences that could impair its performance, and biodegradable to increase their biocompatibility, minimizing a patient’s negative immune response involving removal of the medical device. Table 1 shows the main groups of biomaterials currently used, their main characteristics and applications.

		Regarding toxicology, biomaterials can still be differentiated by their type of response as toxic where surrounding and contiguous tissues die, as nontoxic and biologically inactive when the formation of fibrous tissue of variable thickness occurs, as nontoxic and biologically active with the formation of bonding in the interface zone and as nontoxic and biodegradable when the involving tissue replaces the implant.
		<br><br>
		In the production of medical devices, there are four main types of materials used: metal, ceramics, polymers, and composites. The need to find the most suitable solution for each case makes the choice on the type of material for each application directly related to the natural properties of each material such as its corrosion resistance and biocompatibility, mechanical and metallurgical properties, as well as the performance of the material during its processing and use, cost, and availability.
